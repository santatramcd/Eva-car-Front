    "1-6optionprem" : "1.6 What exactly is the premium option?",
    "voitureflotte" : "Generally, the cars in our fleet are no more than three years old; some of our cars are still brand new. Usually, we assign our cars randomly to customers, which is the most cost-effective way to proceed. Since most of our customers have a pragmatic attitude towards their rental car, our main goal is to offer durable cars at low prices. However, some of our customers were only willing to accept a brand-new car, which led to dissatisfaction among some customers in the past.<br><br> To address this demand, we now offer a premium option where we guarantee that your car will have less than 35,000 km. This option costs only an additional €4.19 per day, which remains a very competitive price compared to major international car rental brands (who often use their cars up to 100,000 km). <br><br>In many cases, the fees only cover the cost of transporting an appropriate car across the island. Therefore, please reserve the premium option only if you wish to receive a brand-new car. If you do not book the option, we will simply use our random assignment method. <br><br>Please be aware that sometimes things do not go according to plan (e.g., due to accidents), and we cannot always keep our promises. If you receive a car with more than 35,000 km, we will refund the premium option fee plus an additional €1.68 per day for the inconvenience. <br><br>Not all of our car models have the premium option. This is because not all of our local suppliers are willing to take on the additional organizational challenge. You can easily find the cars with this option by using the filter settings on our offers page.",
