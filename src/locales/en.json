In some cases it is also possible to pay the rental fee in cash upon delivery. If this option is available, it will be displayed during the booking process. However, if you wish to pay on delivery, we recommend that you book our cancellation insurance. Fees for this insurance must be paid within 2 days of receiving your invoice.",
    "1-3obtenirvoiture": "1.3 Will I get exactly the car I selected?",
    "modelevoiture": "We do our best to provide you with exactly the car model you have reserved. However, there are rare cases where this is not possible, due to accidents, repairs or simply a planning error. Fortunately, you will always receive a car worth the same or more than the one you chose. Cars that have the same rate/day on our website are considered to be of equivalent value.",
    "1-4duréminres": "1.4 Is there a minimum reservation duration?",
    "duréresmin": "The minimum reservation duration depends on the country, model, and availability of the car. You can get an overview of vehicle availability by using our search form. For short term rentals we reserve the right to impose additional charges. Such charges, if they occur, will always be included by default in the prices displayed.<br> <br>Information specific to Seychelles Island: In Seychelles Island, reservations of a minimum duration of four days are always accepted. Reservations of less than two days are never accepted. Reservations for a duration of between two and four days are accepted by our reservation system under certain conditions. This decision is made separately for each car model (If you see the 'Reserve' button, your reservation can be made; if the message 'Reservation period too short' is displayed, you must choose another car and/or one more long reservation period). <br><br>For reservations of less than five days, an additional 15% for each day less is included in the default price, for example: 2 = 2.45, 3 = 3.3 and 4 = 4.15 days.",

Booster seats for children are available free of charge.",
    "1-6optionprem": "1.6 What exactly is the premium option?",
    "voitureflotte": "Generally, the cars in our fleet are no more than three years old; some of our cars are still brand new. Usually, we assign our cars randomly to customers, which is the most cost-effective way to proceed. Since most of our customers have a pragmatic attitude towards their rental car, our main goal is to offer durable cars at low prices. However, some of our customers were only willing to accept a brand-new car, which led to dissatisfaction among some customers in the past.<br><br> To address this demand, we now offer a premium option where we guarantee that your car will have less than 35,000 km. This option costs only an additional €4.19 per day, which remains a very competitive price compared to major international car rental brands (who often use their cars up to 100,000 km). <br><br>In many cases, the fees only cover the cost of transporting an appropriate car across the island. Therefore, please reserve the premium option only if you wish to receive a brand-new car. If you do not book the option, we will simply use our random assignment method. <br><br>Please be aware that sometimes things do not go according to plan (e.g., due to accidents), and we cannot always keep our promises. If you receive a car with more than 35,000 km, we will refund the premium option fee plus an additional €1.68 per day for the inconvenience. <br><br>Not all of our car models have the premium option. This is because not all of our local suppliers are willing to take on the additional organizational challenge. You can easily find the cars with this option by using the filter settings on our offers page.",

    "annulereserv": "If you need to cancel your reservation, you can do so at no extra cost up to 48 hours before the rental period, without any restrictions.

    "apportequalité": "Eva Car Rental brings you quality and reliability. We maintain high standards because we work closely with our partners. Often, these partners also work for large car rental groups. In this case, it happens that each partner has its own policy, and this can become a real headache for customers. Unlike other companies, because we work closely with our partners, we are able to provide a standardized rental process that makes it easier for our customers to rent vehicles and enjoy their vacation. The price is another undeniable advantage of renting from Eva Car Rental. Compared to large rental companies where customers pay more mainly due to expensive marketing programs, at Eva Car Rental you can benefit from the same cars for a reduced cost, and thus take full advantage of the money saved.<br><br>Specific information for Seychelles Island: Eva Car Rental works with many partners in Seychelles Island, who have proven to be reliable and trustworthy partners over the years. If a problem does occur with your rental, we will help you from a neutral point of view. The advantage of having several partners is that we will transfer your booking to the partner who has the cheapest delivery costs to your hotel. Therefore, the delivery costs may vary for each car model and also depend on the availability of cars. All customers who rent a car from us for five days or more will receive a free satellite navigation system. Unfortunately, the Seychelles island is not financially significant for the big navigation system companies like Garmin and Tom Tom. That is why their maps are outdated and contain many errors. Previously, we often received complaints from customers who were guided far from the route in a sugar cane field where they had made a big detour because of bad maps. Therefore, we decided to set up our own version of this map that we can update independently and more quickly than other car rental companies in Seychelles. Additionally, we have included a list of well-known and lesser-known public beaches in Seychelles, and our GPS device will also alert you of known speed camera checks and dangerous areas.",
